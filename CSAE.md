Cyrcl Policy on Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)
Effective: 20th January 2025

1. Purpose
Cyrcl is committed to creating a safe and respectful online environment. We have zero tolerance for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). This policy outlines the standards, protocols, and enforcement mechanisms in place to prevent, detect, and respond to CSAE-related content and behavior on our platform.

2. Scope
This policy applies to all users, content, and activities on Cyrcl, including but not limited to text, images, videos, messages, live interactions, and metadata. It also applies to third-party integrations and partners operating within the Cyrcl ecosystem.

3. Prohibited Conduct
The following are strictly prohibited and will result in immediate action, including account suspension, content removal, and reporting to appropriate authorities:

- Uploading, sharing, or accessing content that depicts or promotes CSAE.

- Grooming, solicitation, or any communication aimed at the exploitation of minors.

- Possession or dissemination of known or suspected child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

- Impersonation of a minor or misrepresentation of age to engage in predatory behavior.

- Use of Cyrcl to facilitate trafficking, coercion, or commercial sexual exploitation of children.


4. Reporting Mechanisms
Users can report suspected CSAE activity using in-app tools or by emailing support@cyrcl.app. All reports are treated with urgency and confidentiality. Cyrcl will cooperate fully with law enforcement and child protection agencies in all relevant jurisdictions.

5. Response and Enforcement
Upon detection or credible report:

Content will be immediately removed.

User accounts involved will be suspended or permanently banned.

Relevant information will be reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) or equivalent legal authorities.

Internal audit and escalation protocols will be activated to prevent recurrence.

6. Collaboration and Transparency
Cyrcl partners with child safety organizations and regulatory bodies to stay current on best practices and contribute to global efforts against CSAE. We publish transparency reports semiannually to disclose enforcement statistics and policy updates.

7. Education and Prevention
We provide educational resources to users, parents, and guardians on digital safety, recognizing grooming behavior, and supporting vulnerable populations.

8. Accountability
This policy is overseen by the Trust & Safety Division at Cyrcl. Failure by staff, contractors, or partners to uphold these standards may result in disciplinary action or termination of contracts.
