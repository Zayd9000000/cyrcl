Child Sexual Abuse & Exploitation (CSAE) Policy
Last updated: January 5, 2025
Cyrcl is committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and protective environment for all users. This document outlines our unwavering stance against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE), which includes the creation, circulation, or facilitation of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). Any breach of this policy will result in immediate action.

What is CSAE and CSAM
Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) refers to any act that harms, exploits, or endangers minors through sexual means. This includes, but is not limited to:
Grooming minors for sexual purposes


Sextortion of a child (e.g., using threats or blackmail to solicit sexual content from minors)


Child sex trafficking and its facilitation


Any attempt to sexualize or endanger a child online or offline


Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) includes any image, video, illustration, animation, or digitally created content that depicts minors involved in sexually explicit acts. Possession, sharing, or production of CSAM is illegal and condemned globally.
Cyrcl explicitly prohibits all content and conduct that sexualizes or exploits children in any form.
